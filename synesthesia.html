    <h1>Understanding Synesthesia and Music</h1>


    <br>

        <p>
            &nbsp; Synesthesia is where one sense automatically triggers another one. Some synesthetes ‘taste’ flavours when they read certain words while others see shapes or colours when they hear specific names.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            &nbsp; If you have music-colour synesthesia, also known as chromesthesia, you might see colours when you hear:
        </p>

        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>Musical notes</li>

            <br>

            <li>Voices</li>

            <br>

            <li>Background noises</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
            &nbsp; While one person might see certain colours from a violin note, for example, another might notice entirely different colours or patterns. 

            The emotion, tempo, and timbre of sounds influence what a synesthete perceives. For some, it might not just be colours but shapes, textures and even moving landscapes.
